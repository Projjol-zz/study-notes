Classification is used to separate data into multiple sets and does this by using a decision boundary
  Example of this would be to classify apples and oranges, i.e. proedict that a given data point falls in which category
Regression helps one understand the data given, i.e regression helps explain why certain data is the way it is. Analogous to a decision boundary in  regression problems is a predictor
  Example would be a house price analayzer, wherein given the size of the house one can predict the price of the house
